# ReactNative-Get-Nearest-Charging-Locations-Mobile
The app is made up of two pieces. A Meteor app that is handling the web browser, the server, and the database connection; and a React Native app that is handling the iOS and Android mobile app.

**Find Nearby Charging Stations:**

Making use of geolocation in React Native. Read data from Meteor server, and make a geospatial query with MongoDB.

**Real-time data:**

Check-in to station with real-time data, allowing you to know where there are unoccupied stations and what's the current activity in those stations.

**User Accounts:**

Only those with a user account can claim charging spots. I'll use the Meteor's robust accounts system for that.
